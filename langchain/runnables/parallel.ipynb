We just took 3rd place in the Polkadot AssetHub Hackathon with Polkaflow, our AI-powered, no-code smart contract builder! üéâ  36 hours of coding magic turned curiosity into a prize-winning project.  #Polkadot #AssetHub #Hackathon #Web3 #AI #SmartContracts #NoCode #Polkaflow', 'linkedin': \"**Option 1 (Concise):**\\n\\nThrilled to share that my team (Abhijith Sogal & Nikhil Kottoli) and I secured 3rd place at the Polkadot AssetHub Hackathon!  üèÜ  In just 36 hours, we built Polkaflow ‚Äì an AI-powered, no-code smart contract builder for Polkadot.  This was my first Web3 hackathon, and the experience was incredible!  #Polkadot #AssetHub #Hackathon #Web3 #NoCode #AI #SmartContracts\\n\\n\\n**Option 2 (More Detailed):**\\n\\nHuge shoutout to my amazing teammates, Abhijith Sogal and Nikhil Kottoli! We just finished the Polkadot AssetHub Hackathon, and our project, Polkaflow, took 3rd place! üéâ  This was my first Web3 hackathon, and it was an intense but incredibly rewarding 36-hour sprint.  We built an AI-powered, no-code smart contract builder with features like a drag-and-drop interface, a hybrid Solidity/Rust compiler, and one-click deployment to AssetHub via PolkaVM.  Polkaflow simplifies smart contract development, making it accessible to a wider audience.

We developed Polkaflow, an AI-powered, no-code smart contract builder designed to democratize smart contract development on Polkadot.  Key features include a visual drag-and-drop interface, AI-powered code generation, and seamless deployment.  This project honed my skills in [mention specific skills like AI, Solidity, Rust, Web3 development etc.], and I'm excited to see where we take Polkaflow next. #Polkadot #AssetHub #Hackathon #Web3 #NoCode #AI #SmartContracts #Blockchain #SoftwareEngineering\\n\\n\\n**Remember to:**\\n\\n* **Add a picture:** A photo of the team at the hackathon or a screenshot of the Polkaflow interface would significantly enhance the post.\\n* **Include a link:** If you have a website, GitHub repository, or any other relevant link for Polkaflow, include it in your post.\\n* **Use relevant hashtags:**  This will increase the visibility of your post.\\n\\n\\nChoose the option that best suits your style and the platform's audience.
